# GECO Asia AI Hackathon Project

This repository contains our submission for the **GECO Asia AI Hackathon**, where we set out to transform the way teams interact with business data. Our goal was simple: **take a conventional dashboard and supercharge it with AI-powered insights**—making data exploration faster, smarter, and conversational.

## 🚀 What We Built

We developed an AI-enhanced analytics solution that goes beyond static charts and tables. The system integrates:

- **AI-powered insight generation**  
  Instantly produces meaningful summaries, highlights anomalies, and surfaces trends without manual digging.

- **Conversational Chatbot Assistant**  
  A natural-language chatbot that can discuss company matters based on the data you provide.  
  Using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, the assistant can ingest your files and respond with context-aware, accurate answers.

- **Actionable Recommendations**  
  The AI not only provides insights—it also suggests next steps and guides decision-making in real time.

- **Personalised, Instant Responses**  
  Ask any question about your data, from high-level summaries to deep-dive queries, and get tailored answers immediately.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Traditional dashboards show you *what* is happening.  
Our AI-powered companion tells you **why**, **so what**, and **what to do next**—all through conversation.

This project showcases how human-AI collaboration can turn raw data into rapid decision-ready intelligence.
